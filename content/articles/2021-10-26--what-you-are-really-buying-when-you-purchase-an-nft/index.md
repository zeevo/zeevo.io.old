# Outline

- Introduction

  - A lot of confusion on what you are actually buying

- What an NFT isn't

  - A literal picture on the block chain
    - Exceptions
      - cryptopunks

- What an NFT is

  - A Smart Contract that stores Metadata
  - IPFS (Good)
  - IPFS Gateways (Bad)

- What makes an NFT valuable

  - A reputable Smart Contract
    - One that publishes their ABI is even better
  - A correct metadata

- Running Geth

  - I choose to run it in docker like this

- Getting ABI

  - Why do we need this?
    - Smart Contracts are compiled bytecode = hard (impossible) to know what they do without an ABI
    - Authors might not want you to interact with their contract

- Querying with Web3
  - geth attach
